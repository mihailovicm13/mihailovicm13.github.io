					<b>Written by <a href="Andy.html">Andy Kim</a></b> (05.05.2019)<br><br>Released October 21, 2014.<br><br>
					<i>Under Pressure</i> is Logic’s first album, released in 2014, which also included a deluxe version with three extra songs, “Driving Ms. Daisy”, “Now”, and “Alright”. Logic was always one of my favorite rappers earlier in my life, and I really
					enjoyed almost every song and album he has released. This album is easily at one of my top albums for Logic, just because of how young he was in his career and his style of rapping really stuck out to me and matched my interests.<br><br> Songs
					like “Buried Alive”, “Gang Related”, “Bounce”, and “Never Enough”, were some of the main songs that I listened to and enjoyed from this album. The music along with the voice and rapping of Logic is just so different than what modern rappers
					sound like. In “Buried Alive”, there is a mix of fast paced music with rapping, but also slow moments to change the tempo of the song. I usually don’t like super long songs, like over 5 minutes, but the songs are good enough to the point where
					I enjoy the long songs that he has released. The content within the songs are worth the extra couple of minutes. <br><br> “Gang Related” has some interesting types of sounds within the song. When I first showed this song to my friend, he was
					kind of confused because he thought I was just playing some random sounds and he didn’t really like it. However, this type of music is good in my eyes because the style of this song is different than most, including orthodox background music
					and sounds, and even talking in the middle of the song. The song includes a news report in the middle of the song, which states that there was a deadly shooting in Gaithersburg, and the lyrics in the song relate to the horrors or struggles that
					he went through as a child. <br><br> Lines like, “Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this”, which refers to his son, that he may have in the future. Logic’s real name is Robert Bryson Hall, and his nickname is also Bobby
					Tarantino. What Logic doesn’t want for his future son is fighting and crime because his father, Logic, has seen the horrible effects and events of crime and violence.<br><br> Many songs in his album follows this pattern of different styles of
					music and impactful, meaningful lyrics. Many of his lyrics incorporate the struggles that he went through as a child and young adult, mentioning “Nikki” multiple times throughout multiple songs. There’s even a song named “Nikki”, referring to
					nicotine, and describing how he was addicted to drugs and struggled with the addiction.<br><br> However, as it turns out, there were many songs that I had never heard off this album until recently I was told to listen and review this album.
					Songs like “Metropolis” and “Soul Food” were two songs that I had just heard, and once again, I was amazed. Even reviewing the songs that I haven’t heard in a long time was a great feeling. “Metropolis” is more of an R&B type of song, which is
					a good contrast to the ret of the album which is more of rap and hip-hop. This song once again matches my type of music, and has a jazz type of beat, and a saxophone in the background, and with the combination of those and the keyboard, the
					song has been probably one of my favorites on the album so far.<br><br> Not only is the music great, but also the way in which Logic just says words is one of the reasons why he has become at the top of my list for favorite rappers. He doesn’t
					mumble when he raps, doesn’t use worthless lyrics, and overall just has flow when he speaks. Every word he says, you can hear, even though at times it may get very fast.<br><br> Over the years, I’ve heard many different opinions on his type of
					rapping and his music in general; many people love him, but there are people out there that can’t stand him. Honestly, I can’t see why some people don’t like this type of rapping. I feel like his style can be very appealing and satisfying to
					anyone who listens.<br><br> Almost every song has some type of conversation within the song or near the end, which kind of gives a plot to the song, but I am still confused as to why that was added or what the purpose of it was. That is
					honestly one of my least favorite aspects of most songs because it ruins the flow and adds unnecessary aspects to the song that I don’t want to listen to.<br><br> Overall, even though there were aspects that I didn’t enjoy, like the
					conversations mid-song, I enjoyed listening to Logic, and still think he is a very skilled and talented artist who deserves more credit than he receives. He has already dropped many more hit songs, and I am eager to see what he has in store in
					the future.<br><br> <b>8.5/10</b><br><br> Highlights: Metropolis, I’m Gone, Gang Related, Buried Alive, Bounce, Never Enough, Nikki, Under Pressure, Till The End, Driving Ms. Daisy, Now, Alright<br><br> Skips: Intro, Growing Pains III<br><br>
