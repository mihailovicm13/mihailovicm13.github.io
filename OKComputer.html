					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (05.05.2019)<br><br>Released June 16, 1997.<br><br>
					<i>OK Computer</i> is arguably the definitive alternative rock album of the late 1990’s, and perhaps even the entire decade. It is the third studio album released by English rock band Radiohead, released on June 16th, 1997.<br><br> Radiohead
					formed in 1985, consisting of schoolmates Thom Yorke, Collin and Johnny Greenwood, Ed O’ Brian, and Philip Selway. In 1993, they released their first album <i>Pablo Honey</i>, and in the same year, their song “Creep” became a worldwide sleeper
					hit – its their best-selling song to this date. Although there are a moments I enjoy on their first two records, I find <i>Pablo Honey</i> to have aged horribly since its release, and The Bends to be somewhat uninteresting (but not a bad
					record).<br><br> <i>OK Computer</i> was a huge change of pace for Radiohead. Instead of straightforward themes and guitar-work typical of the early 90’s, they opted for abstract lyrical content and glitchy instrumentation. This change can be
					heard immediately in the first track, “Airbag”. The lack of clarity in the lyrics can be observed by reading the first lines on the album – “In the next world war, in a jackknifed juggernaut, I am born again”. These lyrics seem to suggest a
					completely different meaning at first, but they are actually an allusion to Thom Yorke’s car accident (and the “Airbag” that saved his life). The glitchy instrumentation can be heard in the drum pattern throughout and the sound effects in the
					second half of the song.<br><br> An aspect of Radiohead’s music that remains unchanged from their previous records are the depressing lyrical settings and instrumentals. Some moments on this album are incomparably melancholic and hopeless.
					Among them include the emotional climax at the end of “Exit Music (For a Film)”, the third switch-up on “Paranoid Android”, and the chorus of “Lucky”. In addition, “Fitter Happier” is an unusual interlude-type track near the middle of the
					album, with a text-to-speech voice stating various daily tasks of many people in a depression fashion, accompanied by off-putting sound-effects and piano.<br><br> There are tracks on this album that take a different approach to mood as well.
					Many tracks have contrasting lyrical and instrumental moods – for example, “Airbag”, “No Mistakes”, and “Let Down”. The instrumentals for the first two are both melancholic and cheerful at different parts, but the lyrical content is completely
					hopeless. They explore themes of death, suicide, and pessimism, respectively.<br><br> Some more common themes on this album include paranoia (“Paranoid Android”, “Climbing Up The Walls”), isolation (“Fitter Happier”, “Subterranean Homesick
					Alien”), depression (“No Mistakes”, “Exit Music”), and politics (“Paranoid Android”, “Electioneering”).<br><br> “Subterranean Homesick Alien” and “The Tourist” are noteworthy because of their spacey and laid-back instrumentals. The slow and
					jazzy instrumentals of both compliment the lyrical themes. In “The Tourist”, the chorus of “hey man, slow down” is meant to symbolize how some people (tourists as a synecdoche here) move in life too quickly. “Subterranean Homesick Alien’s”
					themes of isolation are also complimented by the slow, gloomy instrumental.<br><br> The guitar solos on this album are also notable. “Paranoid Android” contains a guitar solo near the middle that is chaotic and suits the tone of the song
					amazingly, but the best solo on this album is easily the one at the end of “The Tourist”. The high tones are very emotive and are a great way to conclude the album.<br><br> Although I love much of this album, there remain uninteresting moments
					– Namely the unadventurous and uninteresting instrumental of “Let Down” – that has not aged well. “Let Down”, has a dated 90’s pop sound, and “Climbing Up The Walls” / “Electioneering” are decent tracks that feature a typical sound of rock at
					the time, but pale in comparison to the rest of the track-list.<br><br> Many would agree with me in calling <i>OK Computer</i> one of the best rock albums of all time. Although I am not as praiseworthy of it as most rock fans, I still love the
					album. As for whether I prefer it over their succeeding album, <i>Kid A</i>, I am unsure. If you enjoy adventurous instrumentals, abstract lyricism, and want to listen to a more melancholic rock record, then I recommend this album. Even if you
					are not a fan of rock music, this is a great-entry point.<br><br> <b>8/10</b><br><br> Highlights: Airbag, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (For a Film), Karma Police, Fitter Happier, No Surprises, Lucky, <b>The Tourist</b><br><br>
					Skips: <b>Let Down</b>, Electioneering, Climbing Up The Walls<br><br>
