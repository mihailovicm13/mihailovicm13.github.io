UAIS Music Review

The HTML and CSS pages used to create my music review website in 2018/2019. The website is archived at
https://web.archive.org/web/20200215190538/https://uaismusicreview.com/index.html. This was my very first experience with coding at all, and I am very proud of 
the result considering I did everything by myself (even if the website looks very plain). It was very rewarding to make and I look back on the tedious trial-and-error
process of the whole thing fondly.
