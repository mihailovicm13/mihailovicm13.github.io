					<b>Written by <a href="Christian.html">Christian Media</a></b> (07.09.2019)<br><br>Released March 1, 2019.<br><br>DaBaby is a relatively new artist, especially to commercial rap audiences. Released on March 1, 2019, his first studio album, <i>Baby
						on Baby</i>, highlights some of his abilities and develops his unique persona, with DaBaby hailing from Charlotte, North Carolina. Comprised of 13 songs totaling just about 32 minutes long, the album features the lead single of “Suge”, peaking
					at number 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br><br>
					While DaBaby developed a slew of other mixtape projects, <i>Baby on Baby</i> is very clearly the most prominent, that being of studio quality. The beats are quite unique in their sound; after listening to this album, one can really get a taste
					of what beats would dictate a DaBaby track. This enables him to not only make his mark for new listeners, but also let everyone know what he is bringing to the rap game. He utilizes many ad-libs that are oftentimes humorous and very catchy.
					Prominently in “Suge”, DaBaby repeats “Yea Yea” constantly throughout the hook, adding to his personal flair. <br><br>
					With great production quality, it’s important for the lyrics and flow to synchronize into a perfect combination. I believe DaBaby was quite successful in this regard, with very memorable choruses throughout the tracks, including “Baby Sitter”
					and “Goin Baby”. Furthermore, along with catchy choruses, DaBaby implements very memorable lines that also prove to elaborate upon his character. In “Tupac”, DaBaby claims how he is “like the Tupac of the new shit”. At surface value, this line
					would be a very pretentious thing for any rapper to say, nonetheless a new player like DaBaby, by comparing oneself to Tupac. However, as this track comes later in the album, listeners can see that he jokes around quite a bit, this being
					somewhat of an example. Additionally, in “Celebrate”, he “ain’t got no time to celebrate” with “no time for no hoes or no friends”, which we can see from the hard work he has been tangled up in making a name for himself. Lines such as these
					helps develop him in a way to reach out to the listeners. <br><br>
					Another effective aspect of this album is the use of transitional flow. In the order that is presented, all songs serve to lead into one another. Even by breaking the flow, as seen in some of the music videos, there is a very nice interluding
					aspect among these tracks. Examples include “Taking It Out” following “Suge” and “Deal Wit It” following “Baby Sitter”. The features present in this album are also carried out effectively. They serve to supplement DaBaby’s sound while not
					taking over. Migos rapper Offset pairs perfectly in “Baby Sitter”, along with Rich the Kid in “Best Friend”. <br><br>
					Aspects of humor throughout his lyrics are part of what makes this album so much fun to listen to. There are also parts where DaBaby does go hard and isn’t afraid to show some of his lyrical genius. Overall, this album deserves plenty of
					praise, especially considering how it is his first studio album. While my expectations are high for new DaBaby music, I am very eager to see what else he can do. Essentially all of the tracks are enjoyable to constantly play. <br><br>
					<b>8.5/10</b><br><br>
					Favorite Tracks: Taking It Out, Suge, Goin Baby, Baby Sitter<br><br>
					Decent Tracks: Pony, Celebrate, Joggers, Tupac, Carpet Burn, Deal Wit It, Backend, Best Friend<br><br>
					Skips: Walker Texas Ranger<br><br>
					<br><br><b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (07.09.2019)<br><br> I agree with many points of Christian’s review. <i>Baby on Baby</i> is a promising project from the Charlotte rapper that displays much of what one should
					expect from his music. I have my issues with some of his songs, but one thing in particular that I like about DaBaby’s music is the energy and humor that he brings to a track. He does so consistently, even on his features (songs like “Cash
					Shit” by Megan Thee Stallion and the remix of “Stop Snitchin’” by YG), where I feel his personality complements both songs well. Also, he usually picks instrumentals that are a perfect match to his style.<br><br>
					On “Baby Sitter”, my favorite track from the album, DaBaby brings this exact humor and energy I mentioned prior. His aggressive flow and lyrics (“you got a son, you play with me, your son’s a bastard”) go very well with the banging
					instrumental. “Suge” and “Taking It Out” follow a similar formula and end up being great tracks as well. Even on tracks where the instrumental doesn’t wow me, like on “Goin’ Baby”, DaBaby’s personality makes up for it. This is exactly what
					happens on many songs from the project – his humor and charisma can make up for a bad hook or beat.<br><br>
					However, there are duds in the tracklist here too – “Backend” sounds like a less interesting successor to “Suge” with its similar distorted 808s. Also, DaBaby does not bring his distinct charisma on this track. But this is a problem I have with
					many of the songs on this project – a lot of them sound like weaker versions of another. The beat on “Jogger” sounds like a much less interesting version of “Walker Texas Ranger”. And on “Pony” we get a beat very similar to that of “Goin’
					Baby”. Overall, there are some instrumental highlights on this album, but most of the beats here are just decent. I would not say there are any bad ones on this album, just many uninteresting ones.<br><br>
					Continuing with critiques, on “Best Friend”, DaBaby’s attempt at a hook does not go over well. His autotuned hook on “Celebrate” is not as bad but still only mediocre, as DaBaby cannot sing. The features here are passable for the most part, but
					only Offset on “Baby Sitter” stands out. Also, DaBaby tends to reuse flows here and there (listen to the start of “Taking It Out” and “Jogger” back to back). However, despite all of these flaws, I feel that at their worst, they only make the
					songs mediocre, never “bad”. <br><br>
					Overall, <i>Baby on Baby</i> is a pretty decent project, and the hits show why DaBaby is one of my favorite 2019 XXL Freshmen – just stick with the hits and avoid most of the deep cuts.<br><br>
					<b>6/10</b><br><br>
					Favorites: Taking It Out, Suge, <b>Baby Sitter</b><br><br>
					Least Favorites: Jogger, <b>Backend</b><br><br>
