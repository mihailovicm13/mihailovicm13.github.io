					<b>Written by <a href="Avinash.html">Avinash Pillai</a></b> (04.21.2019)<br><br>Released October 2, 2015.<br><br>
					If you’ve ever had a conversation with a really cliché uncle, you would be familiar with not only his opinions on trickle-down economics, but also the phrase “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. And if the world ever got a
					dictionary for unnecessary figures of speech, I’d vote for the album cover of <i>T R A P S O U L</i> to be on that page. Tiller took what was an idea first introduced with Drake’s <i>Nothing Was The Same</i>, and perfected it with his own
					unique, Louisville style.<br><br>
					At first sight, or a random listen to just one of the songs on this 14-song release would result in the question “why is this idiotic writer praising it so much?”. On the surface level, it seems like just another R&B singer who can out-OVO
					Drake himself. However, a true music listener would always point to rule #1 when listening to an artist’s new release: get through the whole thing before formulating an opinion. And as the minutes tick away on “For However Long”, such a very
					important key to judging an album starts to show through. This key is consistency of message. Pen Griffey, Tiller’s alter ego, is portrayed as a guy who never learns from his mistakes, regularly cheating on his girl, only to feel the guilt and
					pain later as she finds out. This consistency of message really starts to show Tiller’s genius in this album.<br><br>
					Consistency isn’t enough though. Plenty of albums have a consistency of message (Culture II) that I’m not really a fan of. Tone and mood is another facet of an exceptional album. Every effect used on his voice, as well as every track has been
					produced with an almost obsession-like precision. Take for example, “502 Come Up”. After a fantastic one-liner (that I would quote, but in the interest of keeping things PG, I’ll let you listen to it yourself) about Louisville Sluggers, the
					famous manufacturer of baseball bats and a direct reference to Tiller’s hometown, a loud, piercing sound of a bat hitting a ball is used. The reverb and proximity to the drop of the bass is meticulously chosen to hype up idiotic high school
					juniors in BMWs while they blast music a bit too loud in a parking lot.<br><br>
					But even these things are not enough for greatness. No, greatness when it comes to a collection of music comes when it influences an entire era. In the same way that Kanye West’s “Heartless” influenced an entire generation of new rap artists in
					the late 2000s, <i>T R A P S O U L</i> led the way to a new direction in R&B, influencing artists like PARTYNEXTDOOR and dvsn. Even Drake, whose releases <i>Nothing Was The Same</i> and <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</i> inspired
					Tiller’s music, released <i>Scorpion</i>, a hit album based on the same half R&B, half hip-hop formula that Tiller so carefully perfected in <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. It changed the way R&B would be as the streaming age came into view, and firmly
					planted Tiller into R&B history.<br><br>
					And now, you’re probably at the last track “Right My Wrongs”, my personal favorite of the entire album. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the smooth vocals, perfectly crafted track from a Submotion Orchestra sample, and lyrics that reflect the message
					Tiller worked so fluidly into every song in the album. Time will tell if we will ever encounter another R&B album so complete and as well crafted as <i>T R A P S O U L</i>. Until then, this remains as one of the best and most influential R&B
					albums of the 21st century.<br><br>
					<b>9/10</b><br><br><br><br><b>Written by <a href="Christian.html">Christian Media</a></b> (04.21.2019)<br><br> <i>Trapsoul</i> (or stylized as <i>T R A P S O U L</i>) is the debut studio album by Louisville artist Bryson Tiller. Released on
					October 2, 2015, Tiller
					demonstrates
					a trap-R&B sound throughout his album. Furthermore, Trapsoul features singles “Don’t”, “Exchange”, and “Sorry Not Sorry”.<br><br>
					Tiller, at an age of 22 at the release of this album, was looking to emerge into the music world with the critically appraised Trapsoul. Accompanied by the starting track “Intro (Difference)”, Tiller establishes the sound that will follow
					throughout the album by singing about his thoughts describing his feelings towards a girl he loves. Tiller sings, “Oh yes, I say, with me it’s different/ Baby, I know you see the difference”. This closing line in the intro track foreshadows
					what listeners will expect for the rest of the album- this theme of falling in love with a girl and expressing what one can bring to the table in a relationship. This theme is rather common as it serves as a relatable sort of situation that
					many listeners have experience with. While I am not against this theme, I feel that it can be overused and overdone, especially if not new ideas are offered. There must be an immense deal of care and appreciation taken in account to musical
					devices such as sound and flow. This review will include analysis of this sound and flow as well as personal reactions and thoughts towards Tiller’s work.<br><br>
					Tiller is able to effectively discuss his thoughts towards this unknown girl he has fallen for as well as communicating his own thoughts using prose. There are not only these tracks present, but also more hip-hop-esque tracks, including “Rambo”
					and “502 Come Up”. This is not to say Tiller’s rap tracks diminish anything from the overall sound of the album- I find it that Tiller executes including these in an appreciable manner. “502 Come Up” is essentially a homage to Tiller’s own
					upbringing in his hometown, Louisville, Kentucky, with “502” being the city’s zip code. He raps about how he “Woke up in the hills this morning/ Asking myself, how did I get here this morning?”, comparing his current lifestyle to his in the
					past. Another notable line present here is “Trapsoul, man, I crack codes”, suggesting that his self-made genre of a trap/soul hybrid is a demonstration of him breaking some sort of code and cheating the game. <br><br>
					Overall, I find Tiller’s sound throughout <i>Trapsoul</i> to be not only well produced but also well executed. It isn’t a very depressing and solemn production; it’s more of a reflective work of Tiller looking back on his run-ins with love as
					well as life and how his has changed. I feel that this distinction is important as using this more positive sound is something that hasn’t been used much by other artists in the R&B scene. Considering this, I appreciate and applaud Tiller’s
					efforts to bring a new sound to the music world. His flow is very consistent and well-maintained throughout the album as well. He shows how he can both rap and sing through the inclusion of some aforementioned essentially hip-hop tracks. <br><br>
					Highlights: 502 Come Up, Exchange, Don’t, Sorry Not Sorry<br><br>
					Skips: Been That Way, Right My Wrongs, Overtime, The Sequence<br><br>
