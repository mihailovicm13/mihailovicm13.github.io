					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (08.16.2019).<br><br>Released June 21, 2019.<br><br>
					The <i>7 EP</i> is the debut EP from Lil Nas X. Nas X experienced a meteoric rise to fame in Spring 2019 off the success of “Old Town Road”. After being in the spotlight for so long without any other music (not counting the remixes of “Old Town
					Road”), many people were anticipating a debut commercial project from Nas X.<br><br>
					On the <i>7 EP</i>, Lil Nas X delivers some decent commercial, genre blending tracks. “Rodeo” is a successful attempt at recreating the country novelty of “Old Town Road” and features an entertaining Cardi B verse. “Panini” finds Lil Nas X
					taking influence from Travis Scott, both vocally and production-wise. The track is isn’t amazing, but just too catchy to dislike. “F9mily (You & Me)” is a surprisingly decent attempt at a rock song by Lil Nas X, even featuring Travis Barker of
					Blink-182 fame on production. And “Old Town Road” and its remixes are still solid bangers, too, putting the hype and popularity aside.<br><br>
					This EP has its flaws, however. While “F9mily” was not a bad attempt at a rock song by Nas X, the uninteresting lyrical content makes me not entirely disagree with Pitchfork describing the song as <a href=”https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-nas-x-7-ep/”>“a
					  cheap rock song made to be performed at summer camp talent shows”</a>. Meanwhile, a poor attempt at another rock song on the EP is “Bring U Down” which features an uninteresting instrumental and vapid lyrics. “Kick It” is about a fake friend
					  who only cares about Nas X because of his popularity. The track is somewhat noteworthy lyrically, but this does not make up for the lifeless instrumental and Nas X’s unconvincing delivery. And as much as I like the closer track, the confusing
					  production choice of vinyl crackling noises single-handedly ruin the song for me.<br><br>
						Overall, there is not much to say about this EP. I enjoyed some of the genre-blending on the <i>7 EP</i>, but there are a few uninteresting lyrics and bland / dated instrumentals that hold it back. It is a flawed but still promising project
						from Lil Nas X.<br><br>
