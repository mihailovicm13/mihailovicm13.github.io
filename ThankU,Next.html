					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (09.01.2019)<br><br>Released February 8, 2019.<br><br>

					<i>thank u, next</i> is the fifth studio album from singer Ariana Grande. It quickly followed her 2018 release, <i>Sweetener</i> – it was released only five months after. I have always enjoyed many of Ariana Grande’s songs, and believe that she
					has better vocal talent than many of her pop contemporaries.<br><br>
					This album is considerably darker than an album of Ariana’s like <i>My Everything</i>, or even last year’s <i>Sweetener</i>. For context, in 2017, Ariana Grande’s concert in Manchester was the target of a terrorist attack leaving 23 dead and
					139 wounded. Whereas <i>Sweetener</i> felt hopeful and uplifting on tracks like “no tears left to cry” or “get well soon”, <i>thank u, next</i> is a display of the various coping methods Ariana uses to “numb the pain” of such tragedies. In
					addition, after <i>Sweetener</i>, she called off her engagement with Pete Davidson, and her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died. All these events culminate in <i>thank u, next’s</i> depressing lyrical content.<br><br>
					Despite the record’s general tone, it begins with the hopeful 6/8 ballad “imagine”. Lyrically, it is reminiscent of the opener to her 2014 album “Yours Truly” – she says to “imagine a world like that”, or rather, a perfect relationship.
					However, there is a sense of sadness to this song, as it describes an <a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1062779269129003008">"unattainable" love</a>. It is a nice way to start the record, and Ariana’s high register whistles at
					the
					end of the song are impressive. The album immediately shifts its tonal direction with the song “needy”. In this song, Ariana describes her need for dependence, apologizing for her behavior but stating that “after all this damage, [she] can’t
					help it”.<br><br>
					Other songs that deal with Ariana’s coping mechanisms are “fake smile”, where she talks about not being able to hide her trauma, and “7 rings”, a song about “retail therapy”. There are a few more hopeful songs, too, however. “ghostin” is a
					very sad song lyrically, but it is still optimistic: (“we’ll get through this, we’ll get past this”). The title track is also optimistic, and shows Ariana reminiscing on what she learned from prior relationships. Topically, I found it similar
					to Frank Ocean’s “Pink + White”. There are also cuts on here about relationships, describing them in a both positive and negative light. In the latter case, “in my head” is a song about falling in love with the version of someone you created
					in your head, and not the person in reality. Meanwhile, “make up” is about making up with your partner after an argument. Overall, I enjoyed the many topics Ariana covered on <i>thank u, next</i>, and the general theme of the album.<br><br>
					Delivery-wise, Ariana does not disappoint. The chorus of “bloodline” is anthemic, and on “imagine”, her vocals sound grand over the minimal instrumentation. The hook on “NASA” is fun and catchy, and “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored”
					is another fun and light-hearted track. Also, the rapping on the end of “7 rings” is solid and catchy. Ariana Grande is a great vocalist, so I unsurprisingly enjoyed her performances on every song.<br><br>
					However, the aspect of the album that greatly drags it down for me is the production. I was disappointed by the absence of Pharrell Williams on <i>thank u, next</i>, who created many instrumental highlights on <i>Sweetener</i>. The stretch in
					the album from “fake smile” to “in my head” (excluding “make up”) is where I find the production to be uninteresting (even if I think it compliments the song topics well). Much of the production on here is a cross between trap and Disney
					soundtrack instrumentals (“bad idea” and “ghostin”, respectively). “ghostin” is admittedly very cinematic and pretty, but I could not personally sit through the track and stay interested for more than 1 minute. These songs in this stretch of
					the record comprise my least favorite songs on the album, only due to the production which makes them a bore to listen to (outside of their lyrical content). However, this does not mean that there are not instrumental highlights, like the
					gloomy keys and beautiful string closer on “needy”, the trap instrumentals on “7 rings” and “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored”, and the reggae-inspired brass on the trap anthem “bloodline”. I also liked the playful keys on “make up”,
					which reminded me “needy” earlier in the tracklist.<br><br>
					Overall, <i>thank u, next</i> is Ariana’s most impressive album topically, but many of the deep-cuts in the middle of the album are disappointing production-wise. Regardless, there are still many fun and emotionally-moving highlights on this
					album.<br><br>

					<b>6/10</b><br><br>
					Highlights: <b>needy</b>; bloodline; 7 rings; thank u, next; break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored <br><br>
					Skips: fake smile, bad idea, <b>ghostin</b>, in my head<br><br>
