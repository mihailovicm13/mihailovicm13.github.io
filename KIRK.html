					<b>Written by <a href="Christian.html">Christian Media</a></b> (11.03.2019).<br><br>Released September 27, 2019.<br><br>
					On September 27, 2019, Jonathan Kirk, known as DaBaby, released his second studio album, <i>Kirk</i>. Following his studio debut album, Baby on Baby released earlier this year, Kirk attempts to build upon DaBaby’s legitimacy as an artist.
					Moreover, his breakout-status led to further high anticipation of this project, being released only months after his debut album.<br><br>
					The cover art and name of the album provides first impressions that there will be communications of his family and his personal life. In a discussion with 16 Bars, DaBaby described the title of his album: “Kirk, my last name, it holds big
					weight. It’s all about confidence, being a leader. It’s going to be the title of my new album, too, by the way.” This helps describe the nature of the work, and through some analysis of lyrics we can verify how effective this may be.<br><br>
					Kirk contains 13 tracks with various features, including the company of Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, and Migos, among others. While this review won’t focus fully on contrasts between <i>Kirk</i> and <i>Baby on Baby</i>, it’s clear that there
					are many more features in this work. Baby on Baby had few well-known rappers appearing on tracks, while <i>Kirk</i> has plenty more. This coincides with the fact that DaBaby has built onto his breakout persona and linking up with other artists
					in the rap game.<br><br>
					The lead single in <i>Kirk</i> is the first track titled “INTRO”. There is hard-hitting lyricism in this track, communicating some of a story in responding to his father’s death. Many lines include appreciation for his family, primarily in the
					chorus, “Don’t give a f*** about the world, just ‘bout my people”. Further present is the notion of how this isn’t your ordinary rap song is shown from his claim, “Like on this song, I ain’t rappin, I’m preachin’”. “Intro” is such a dynamic
					track that is much different from the likes of his previous work. Lots of his work prior to <i>Kirk</i> presented a very cocky and bashful demeanor on the part of DaBaby, where here he is communicating to his fans. This track is quite
					successful in showing that he can both rap and speak to the listener at the same time, and that his raps also have meaning.<br><br>
					Other tracks further communicate his confidence as shown from <i>Baby on Baby</i>. In “Bop”, we can see this through the lines “You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man” and “I woke up, couple mil’ on my plate”. He has the confidence
					to communicate that he knows rap fans have been waiting for his music without any fear. Furthermore, in “Off The Rip”, we see DaBaby showing how he doesn’t need any other rappers. He calls out how “I can’t name a rapper that’s out here and
					breathin’ that’s f***in’ with me”, and how this does not faze him. He speaks of how he will continue to make money and acknowledges how others are fake with him just to ride his success.<br><br>
					Moving on to the reception of the album, on the week of its release Kirk moved 145,000 album-equivalent units. It peaked #1 on the Billboard 200 on October 12th, 2019. Baby on Baby peaked at #7 on the same chart, already showcasing that DaBaby
					was able to prove how his rapping ability is legitimate. Many of the tracks have well-executed choruses with memorable hooks. Various flows and beats are also incorporated, further diversifying the nature of the work. While <i>Kirk</i> isn’t
					primarily a personal narrative, tracks such as “Intro” demonstrate that he is comfortable in producing hits. I enjoyed this album even more than <i>Baby on Baby</i> from seeing how DaBaby continues to build upon his successes, although some
					tracks are forgettable.<br><br>
