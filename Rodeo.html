					<b>Written by <a href="Christian.html">Christian Media</a></b> (09.08.2019).<br><br>Released September 4, 2015.<br><br>
					Travis Scott released his first studio album <i>Rodeo</i> in 2015. Featured on the record includes many big names, such as Future, Kanye West, The Weeknd, and Quavo. This album follows his first two mixtapes, <i>Owl Pharaoh</i> and <i>Days
						Before Rodeo</i>. The 14-track album was also later released with a deluxe edition, adding “Never Catch Me” and “OK Alright” featuring SchoolboyQ. Two singles were included in <i>Rodeo</i>; “Antidote” and “3500”. “Antidote” quickly became one
					of Scott’s biggest hits, peaking at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br><br>
					Since his previous work was <i>Days Before Rodeo</i>, one would assume that Rodeo would, in a sense, pick up where the former mixtape left off. Instead, what you have is Travis Scott transitioning into a well-known artist in the rap game from
					his humble beginnings producing mixtapes. There is a clear increase in production value seen in his debut album. His lyrical flow is much more appreciable as well as actual content. Furthermore, many tracks feature rapper T.I. as a sort of
					narrator through Travis Scott’s actions and life choices. The first track in the album features an intro from T.I. saying how “We have ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized with a story of a young rebel against the system” and mentioning
					“the one known Jacques turned to Scott / Chose to jump of his mama porch”. In fact, Travis Scott is simply a stage name for Jacques Webster. Other tracks feature this inclusion of referring to Travis as “La Flame”, his nickname, as well as his
					real name in Jacques. This sets up Webster as this rebellious young adult feeling lost, with his own interests in mind. Following his clear success in the music industry, the track closes with T.I. stating, “La Flame says, let your ambition
					carry you”, which further emphasizes this narrative.<br><br>
					It’s common for an artist to communicate their life through their music. However, it’s not inherently successful or the right choice for all artists to make. Travis Scott’s inclusion of his life is sprinkled throughout this album, as well as
					other pursuits of hedonism in efforts to achieve fame. This commentary is apparent in the 5th track titled “90210”, which Scott has directly referred to as his favorite track. One standout line is “Jacques turn La Flame, now he rolling on a
					Addy”, emphasizing how mentioned trips from L.A. and Texas leads to turning Jacques Webster into Travis Scott. This track pops out for a few reasons. First, it does communicate this idea of Scott’s lifestyle. Second, there is a very calming
					melody, leading into a beat switch upping the tempo of this music. The instrumentals themselves greatly support this song. This beat switch, following a much quicker pace of rapping by Scott, is one of the most successful and prominent switches
					I have heard. The bars following the beat switch greatly supports Scott’s rapping ability showcased to long-time fans as well as new ragers.<br><br>
					While this review won’t focus on every track itself, the ones mentioned stood out due to their contribution to the album as well as demonstrating Scott’s rapping skills. The overall production value is very great, as most beats present are
					catchy and set the tone of the track well. This comes in large part due to Mike Dean, a well-known producer who would later help develop <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i> as well as Astroworld.<br><br>
					Scott’s lyricism can be analyzed and pondered upon for the first significant time, due to Rodeo being a studio album. He pairs excellently with some of the features present, especially with his mentor and idol in Kanye West. The title “Piss On
					Your Grave” with both Ye and La Flame seems to be a sort of experimental or outlandish track. It features a quickfire tempo through a short chorus and lines of Travis Scott angrily rapping to an intense rock-esque beat. He comments further on
					his upbringings through the line “Told mama, Bitch, get back in the door”, very utterly representing his rebellious side. While this may seem very intense to some, it is more about how he is building these bits of knowledge representing his
					background to speak out to his fans. This isn’t an attempt by Scott to be cynical or reminiscent, but to report his emotions and large actions.<br><br>
					Overall, Rodeo is a very outstanding album, one of which that won’t be forgotten as one of Travis Scott’s greatest works. The commanding lyricism greatly contributes to the appeal felt through this album, as well as the communication of many
					events in Webster’s life. One feels more connected to him after hearing about his life.<br><br>

					<br><br><b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (11.10.2019)<br><br>
					<i>Rodeo</i> is Travis Scott’s magnum opus. In comparison to other albums in his discography, like <i>Owl Pharaoh</i> and <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i>, it is clearly the most substantive and note-worthy. Just looking at the song
					lengths and collaboration list, one can tell that there was a certain drive on Scott’s part to make this project a cohesive artistic statement. For one, many of the song lengths exceed 5 minutes – allowing for the successful development of
					musical ideas to occur in most of the songs on the album. In addition, the collaborator list on <i>Rodeo</i> is interesting for a trap album in its lane, featuring artists like Pharrell Williams, Justin Bieber, and even chillwave pioneer Toro y
					Moi.<br><br>
					The record is conceptual, with trap legend T.I. narrating Travis Scott’s come-up story throughout various points of the record. Despite many disagreeing, I would definitely call <i>Rodeo</i> a concept album. Almost every track features Travis
					talking about his past, and how far he has come since. To quote Scott, <i>Rodeo</i> is a record displaying how “Jacques turned La Flame” (Jacques is Scott’s first name, and “La Flame” is a stage name of his). But lyrical themes aren’t the only
					manner in which <i>Rodeo</i> maintains its cohesiveness. <i>Rodeo</i> is a concept album about how <i>Rodeo’s</i> cohesiveness instead comes in the manner of a uniform, intoxicating vibe: Cuts like “Maria I’m Drunk”, “Pornography”, and “I Can
					Tell” best exemplify the sound of the album and why it so addicting. These tracks have certain high energy to them while maintaining Travis Scott’s dark, nihilistic atmosphere. And that’s what Travis Scott mastered on <i>Rodeo</i> – the energy
					is almost never compromised in order to keep the vibe. Even on tracks you could call “lower-energy”, like “Impossible”, the vibe is so other-worldly and unique that it keeps the listener engaged for the entire experience. And it may sound like
					an exaggeration, but <i>Rodeo</i>, in my opinion is not just an album, it’s a woozy, intoxicating experience – an adventure into the mind of “La Flame” himself.<br><br>

					The record starts off with a bang on “Pornography”. Immediately, we are introduced to the grim narration of Travis Scott’s come-up story by T.I., as previously mentioned. Then, as the distorted guitar intro slowly builds up, and we get our
					first taste of <i>Rodeo’s</i> intoxicating vibe and lyrical themes. The maximalist, minor-key production courtesy of Mike Dean and various other collaborators, like Metro Boomin, is what the listener will hear much more of for the rest of the
					album. It sets the lyrical stage perfectly for the distinctly hedonistic chorus of the song: “No monogamy, ménage with me / pornography, surrounding me”. Travis Scott successfully matches the lyrical topics with the aesthetic being created – it
					creates commentary on the negative side-effects that come with his vices. Also on “Pornography”, the listener gets their first taste of how many of Travis’s songs are structured. Like on many songs on prior projects <i>Owl Pharaoh</i> and <i>Days
						Before Rodeo</i>, beat-switches (usually mid-way through the song) commonly occur in many of the songs on <i>Rodeo</i> too. Well, the switch-up on “Pornography” is not nearly as dramatic as the beat-switches on other songs, but nonetheless the
					track becomes faster paced and Scott begins to showcase a faster rapping flow. Overall, the track is an amazing introduction to the album and sets up the album’s essential elements that make it so captivating.<br><br>

					The album then moves into “Oh My Dis Side” – the first real introduction to the beat-switch song structures mentioned prior. “Oh My” is a gritty trap banger featuring menacing guitar loops, while “Dis Side” is almost like a blissful dream-state
					coming after the harsh first half of the song. And Travis does not just use these beat-switches for the hell of it – each half either contrasts or builds off the other. The first half of the track, “Oh My”, sees Travis Scott and Quavo
					reminiscing on negative past experiences: “I’ve been in and out the courthouse” and “Mama kicked me out the house now” are lyrics that illustrate this. Meanwhile, on second half, the lyrical themes of having overcome these struggles and finally
					being on “Dis Side” are complimented by the smooth production. It is reasonable to conclude that “Dis Side” is a dream-state of some sort, and from this elevated position, Quavo and Travis reminisce yet again. But this time it is more of a
					nostalgic, positive reflection. Again, the production of the first half is bass-heavy, loud, and dark – complimenting the darker lyrical themes. And on the second half, the R&B-esque chord progression mixed with the care-free timbre of the
					synths perfectly compliment the lighter mood.<br><br>
					To skip forward in the tracklist, the songs “90210” and “Maria I’m Drunk” are the other two notable instances of such beat-switches on <i>Rodeo</i>. On the former, a beautiful synth-centric ballad kicks off the entire track. Similar to “Oh My
					Dis Side”, the song’s two halves contrast each other in order to portray two different time periods of Scott’s life. The first, menacing half of the track covers themes of sex and substance abuse. The pornstar girl, of whom the first verse
					centers around, is unentrenched in the hedonistic, drug-filled world Travis also finds himself in. The track reaches a loud climax, and suddenly, the track fades into a light-hearted second half that draws many parallels to “Dis Side”. The
					loud, distorted production of the first half shifts into a laid-back boom-bap beat backed by some crisp piano chords. And on this half, like on “Dis Side”, Travis’s lyrical content changes as well. He begins to make observations on his current
					state, his family life, and other more personal topics. This second half kicks off with the iconic lines: “My granny called, she said Travie you work too hard / I’m worried you forget about me”. It is easy to see why “90210” is the fan favorite
					Travis Scott song – so if there’s only one song you check out after reading this review, make sure it’s this one (personally, this song was my introduction to Travis Scott a few years ago).<br><br>
					Next, the other two-part track, “Maria I’m Drunk”, is <i>Rodeo’s</i> indulgent, druggy climax. In the first half, “Maria”, Travis personifies marijuana as a woman he is attracted to. It is very atmospheric and airy, feeling like it must be
					leading into something bigger; and it only lasts a little over a minute before warping into the intoxicating second half: “I’m Drunk”. If you couldn’t already tell, its song about “calling your friends” and “getting drunk”, of course (as Young
					Thug puts it so infectiously). Featuring both Thugger and Justin Bieber, the three have amazing chemistry on the track. Bieber drops a surprisingly great rap verse that fits perfectly into the theme of the song, and Young Thug’s eccentric
					delivery compliments the unpredictable, mysterious tone of the song. Backing all of this is a menacing, detuned piano loop paired with dreary synthesizer chords and a bouncy ascending bassline. It is truly a haunting but entrancing moment on
					the record.<br><br>
					On the tracks “Wasted” and “Impossible”, the hedonism and dark vibe of “Maria I’m Drunk” is also present in spades. “Wasted” is another track about alcohol, but Travis’s verse is less focused on just this theme and touches upon a key theme
					present throughout the album, as we’ve seen: his come-up. Meanwhile, Juicy J’s track taps a bit more into the idea of the track as one would judge from the title, and an uncredited Pimp C chorus (R.I.P.) brings a certain punch and hype factor
					to the song. Similar to the repetitive, dark piano loop on “I’m Drunk”, “Wasted” predominantly features a flute sample set in a minor key. While dark, the booming 808’s and performances throughout the song keep its energy high. “Impossible”, on
					the other hand, is a low-key cut in the second leg of the album that is slow and woozy, but appealing in the discomforting vibe it creates. The looming swirls of synth and the gloomy background vocals are hauntingly beautiful, and all create
					the lifeless, hollow soundscape. And lyrically, Travis gets sentimental over a significant other who does not show him love – it’s “impossible” for him to move past this relationship, despite its one-sided dynamic. In a way, it’s kind of like
					the nightmarish sequel to Drake’s “Marvin’s Room”.<br><br>
					For the most part, as mentioned in the start of the review, most of the songs detail Scott’s come-up story. This is most present on the tracks “I Can Tell” and “Apple Pie”. The former is a dark trap banger that is instrumentally similar to
					other tracks on the album. “Apple Pie”, on the other hand, is a sweeter cut backed by ascending piano chords that closes out the album. Both songs cover topics Travis discusses on other previously mentioned tracks on the album, which is why I
					won’t dive heavily into their lyrical themes. Both are instrumentally dense and further demonstrate the maximalist nature of the production on <i>Rodeo</i>.<br><br>
					Aside from the previously mentioned bangers like “Wasted” and “I Can Tell”, other tracks on <i>Rodeo</i> have the purpose of being turn-up, hype songs. Among these are “Antidote”: a Billboard Hot 100 hit single, “3500”, “Nightcrawler”, and
					“Piss on Your Grave”. All of these songs are fun, party anthems that aren’t very personal thematically, but that doesn’t matter. No one is listening for that in any of these songs – all I want is a catchy chorus, a few funny punchlines, and a
					certain high level of energy. This is exactly what all of these songs provide. On “Antidote”, La Flame displays his ability to create an ear-grabbing hook. And on the third verse, Scott comes through with the tightest flows on the record. Every
					featured artist does their job on “3500”, and “Nightcrawler”, bass-heavy hype songs (the former a bit on the longer side). And on “Piss on Your Grave”, Travis and provides a hilarious, high level of energy as Kanye spits: “Piss on your grave /
					Turn this up teacher, play this in the third grade”.<br><br>
					That leaves only a few tracks unmentioned. “Pray 4 Love” is a beautiful, maximalist trap ballad featuring loud bass tones, clean piano chords, and heavy vocal manipulations on both Travis and The Weeknd’s voice. The prominent synths on this
					track, and many other tracks on this album add another element to the maximalist production style exhibited on <i>Rodeo</i>. Also, the The Weeknd delivers a gorgeous finishing verse and chorus on the song, with many quotables.<br><br>
					And to close off the review, “Flying High” is a fun banger that blends Toro y Moi and Travis’s styles in a very fun way. The bridge on this track is absolutely stunning, and screams Pharrell (who did in fact produce the track). It’s one of my
					favorites due to the production and the chemistry Travis and Chaz have.<br><br>
					To bring up complaints, I actually don’t have any. There are no issues with the standard version of this album to me. If this were a review of the deluxe version, which isn’t, I would say “Never Catch Me” would be the only skip. Many people
					generally point to a few tracks in their criticism of this album, so here is where I will provide some counter-arguments (even though, at the end of the day, taste in music is subjective). First of all, “Wasted” is agreed by many to be a weaker
					track in the track-list, due to its slower tempo. Personally, this is a plus to me, and the slower nature of the track contributes to the whole intoxicating feeling to the song – it is called “Wasted”, after all. Coupled with the Pimp C sample,
					Juicy J feature, and prominent 808s, I actually find this track to maintain a very high energy level, especially after Travis’s verse.<br><br>
					Secondly, critics point to “Piss on Your Grave” as a bump in the album. I couldn’t disagree more. To me, this song is pure fun. To dismiss it for the juvenile lyricism is a misguided critique – the whole track is aggressive and meant for
					turning up.<br><br>
					Next, “Flying High” is the universally agreed upon “skip” track of <i>Rodeo</i>. I understand why, personally, but the track does too much for me to agree remotely. The bridge, as I previously mentioned, is gorgeous. The blend of production
					styles from Pharrell, Travis, Dean, and Ritter works perfectly in my opinion.<br><br>
					Lastly, many criticize the overly long song length of “3500”, standing at 7:42. I will make only one concession here and say that I wouldn’t mind if it were shorter. However, I don’t mind its longer length either, and personally enjoy the
					production break-down at the end. Also, the longer length of the track gives for 2 Chainz and Future to give the great performances that they do.<br><br>
					In conclusion, <i>Rodeo</i> is a perfect album in my eyes. There are no missteps in the tracklist. The production is stunning, haunting, loud, but always maximalist. And Travis displays his talent as a potent songwriter. Check it out – you
					won’t be disappointed.<br><br>
