					<b>Written by <a href="Christian.html">Christian Media</a></b> (09.08.2019).<br><br>Released September 4, 2015.<br><br>
					Travis Scott released his first studio album <i>Rodeo</i> in 2015. Featured on the record includes many big names, such as Future, Kanye West, The Weeknd, and Quavo. This album follows his first two mixtapes, <i>Owl Pharaoh</i> and <i>Days
						Before Rodeo</i>. The 14-track album was also later released with a deluxe edition, adding “Never Catch Me” and “OK Alright” featuring SchoolboyQ. Two singles were included in <i>Rodeo</i>; “Antidote” and “3500”. “Antidote” quickly became one
					of Scott’s biggest hits, peaking at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100.<br><br>
					Since his previous work was <i>Days Before Rodeo</i>, one would assume that Rodeo would, in a sense, pick up where the former mixtape left off. Instead, what you have is Travis Scott transitioning into a well-known artist in the rap game from
					his humble beginnings producing mixtapes. There is a clear increase in production value seen in his debut album. His lyrical flow is much more appreciable as well as actual content. Furthermore, many tracks feature rapper T.I. as a sort of
					narrator through Travis Scott’s actions and life choices. The first track in the album features an intro from T.I. saying how “We have ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized with a story of a young rebel against the system” and mentioning
					“the one known Jacques turned to Scott / Chose to jump of his mama porch”. In fact, Travis Scott is simply a stage name for Jacques Webster. Other tracks feature this inclusion of referring to Travis as “La Flame”, his nickname, as well as his
					real name in Jacques. This sets up Webster as this rebellious young adult feeling lost, with his own interests in mind. Following his clear success in the music industry, the track closes with T.I. stating, “La Flame says, let your ambition
					carry you”, which further emphasizes this narrative.<br><br>
					It’s common for an artist to communicate their life through their music. However, it’s not inherently successful or the right choice for all artists to make. Travis Scott’s inclusion of his life is sprinkled throughout this album, as well as
					other pursuits of hedonism in efforts to achieve fame. This commentary is apparent in the 5th track titled “90210”, which Scott has directly referred to as his favorite track. One standout line is “Jacques turn La Flame, now he rolling on a
					Addy”, emphasizing how mentioned trips from L.A. and Texas leads to turning Jacques Webster into Travis Scott. This track pops out for a few reasons. First, it does communicate this idea of Scott’s lifestyle. Second, there is a very calming
					melody, leading into a beat switch upping the tempo of this music. The instrumentals themselves greatly support this song. This beat switch, following a much quicker pace of rapping by Scott, is one of the most successful and prominent switches
					I have heard. The bars following the beat switch greatly supports Scott’s rapping ability showcased to long-time fans as well as new ragers.<br><br>
					While this review won’t focus on every track itself, the ones mentioned stood out due to their contribution to the album as well as demonstrating Scott’s rapping skills. The overall production value is very great, as most beats present are
					catchy and set the tone of the track well. This comes in large part due to Mike Dean, a well-known producer who would later help develop <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i> as well as Astroworld.<br><br>
					Scott’s lyricism can be analyzed and pondered upon for the first significant time, due to Rodeo being a studio album. He pairs excellently with some of the features present, especially with his mentor and idol in Kanye West. The title “Piss On
					Your Grave” with both Ye and La Flame seems to be a sort of experimental or outlandish track. It features a quickfire tempo through a short chorus and lines of Travis Scott angrily rapping to an intense rock-esque beat. He comments further on
					his upbringings through the line “Told mama, Bitch, get back in the door”, very utterly representing his rebellious side. While this may seem very intense to some, it is more about how he is building these bits of knowledge representing his
					background to speak out to his fans. This isn’t an attempt by Scott to be cynical or reminiscent, but to report his emotions and large actions.<br><br>
					Overall, Rodeo is a very outstanding album, one of which that won’t be forgotten as one of Travis Scott’s greatest works. The commanding lyricism greatly contributes to the appeal felt through this album, as well as the communication of many
					events in Webster’s life. One feels more connected to him after hearing about his life.<br><br>
