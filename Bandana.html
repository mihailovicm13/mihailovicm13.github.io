					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (08.16.2019).<br><br>Released June 28, 2019.<br><br>
					<i>Bandana</i> is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2014’s <i>Piñata</i>, a collaboration between rapper Freddie Gibbs and prolific hip-hop producer Madlib. With <i>Piñata</i> being one of the most critically acclaimed hip-hop albums of
					the decade, many people were excited for this album.<br><br>
					For both Madlib and Freddie Gibbs, nothing on this album seems to be out of their comfort zones. Gibbs is still rapping about
					slanging cocaine and his gangster lifestyle in general, and Madlib brings his sample-heavy production as usual. Although
					<i>Piñata</i> had a mix of hard-hitting instrumentals (“Real” and its title track) and laid back ones (“Watts” and “Robes”),
					the instrumentals on <i>Bandana</i> lean towards the latter. The last few tracks on the album are very low-key. The only obvious
					deviation from Madlib’s usual production style is the trap instrumental in the first half of “Half Manne Half Cocaine”.<br><br>
					Similar to <i>Piñata</i>, <i>Bandana</i> starts with a short intro skit followed by another short track. The feature list is almost
					as impressive as <i>Piñata’s</i> – featuring names like Pusha T, Killer Mike, Anderson .Paak, and Black Thought. However, this
					album is more of a solo effort from Gibbs, who carries most of the tracks by himself.<br><br>
					Freddie Gibbs, as expected, delivers A-tier rapping throughout this whole album. Even on the tracks I would skip, it’s
					only because of the production -- I still enjoy Gibb’s rapping. He effectively depicts his criminal lifestyle through dark
					similes and metaphors. I found many lines on here funny, like “Keepin’ a baby .380 with me like Khaled stay with Asahd” on “Giannis”, and “F*** the needle, she just puff and sniff, Snuffleupagus” on “Half Manne Half Cocaine”. Also, I anytime in
					the album where Gibbs would diss someone was enjoyable – whether it be 21 Savage, or the person who “went and bought Jeezy a pair of new shoes”. The only lyrical moment on this album that many people including myself found to be odd was the
					anti-vax line on “Palmolive”: “Maxine Waters, f*** your poison, keep your vaccines off us”. However, the line was still set up creatively enough in the prior line for me to not really nitpick on Gibb’s anti-vax stance. On the feature-side,
					Pusha-T’s lyrical content is a natural marriage with Freddie Gibbs’. Anderson .Paak and Killer Mike deliver good hooks on their respective features, while Mos Def and Black Thought deliver solid verses.<br><br>
					There are many production highlights on the album courtesy of Madlib: the amazing switch-up and gritty production on both halves of “Half Manne Half Cocaine”, the smooth Rhodes keyboard loops on “Crime Pays” (one of my favorite songs of 2019),
					the banging beats on “Flat Tummy Tea” and “Giannis”, and the low-key instrumentals of “Practice” and “Cataracts”. One instrumental I already loved going into this album was on “Education” – Kanye used the same sample when producing “Bonjour” on
					the Nas album last year. However, it is Madlib's production that makes or breaks any of the tracks here, as Gibbs delivers on every track. Despite various instrumental highlights, some tracks feature beats that are too bare for my taste. The
					instrumental on “Massage Seats” is essentially just a single looped vocal sample, and I found the vocal sample on “Palmolive” to
					be fairly tedious as well. The beats on “Gat Damn” and “Soul Right” were not bad, but the samples just became too repetitive after hearing them for 3 minutes. Not all of Madlib’s beats are compelling on “Bandana”, but there is a consistent
					quality that none of his production dips below.<br><br>
					Although Freddie Gibbs raps almost flawlessly, it is Madlib’s production on a few tracks here that drags the project down for me. Overall, <i>Bandana</i> lived up to its hype. It is a pretty good album, with amazing highs and merely forgettable
					lows.<br><br>


					<b>7/10</b><br><br>

					Highlights: Half Manne Half Cocaine, <b>Crime Pays</b>, Cataracts, Education<br><br>
