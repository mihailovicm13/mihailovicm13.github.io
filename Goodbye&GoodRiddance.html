					<b>Written by Christian Media (04.21.2019)</b><br>Released May 23, 2018.<br><br><i>Goodbye & Good Riddance</i> is Juice WRLD’s debut studio album. Juice WRLD has emerged on SoundCloud before producing this album featuring singles “All Girls Are
					the Same”,
					“Lucid Dreams”, “Lean wit
					Me”, “Wasted”, and “Armed and Dangerous”.<br><br>
					The album, released on May 23, 2018, establishes Juice WRLD’s sound as a young artist. More importantly, this sound is commercially presented to far more listeners than his SoundCloud fans. Juice WRLD’s music has rather depressing diction –
					commonly present – possibly reflecting his life and experiences with heartbreak, along with his drug use due to his sadness. Classified with the genre of emo rap or alternative, this sound is very somber and particularly thought-provoking to
					empathetic audiences. This is not to say that his music is only designed for these audiences – many of his singles have been insanely popular, including the likes of “Lucid Dreams”. Furthermore, <i>Goodbye & Good Riddance</i> contains only one
					feature, with Lil Uzi Vert on “Wasted”. This emphasizes how this album truly reflects Juice WRLD’s music and what he has to offer in the music world.<br><br>
					Looking at the sales of his album, it sold 39,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. On the US Billboard 200, <i>Goodbye & Good Riddance</i> debuted at number fifteen. This truly is an outstanding metric, having your debut album start
					off that high on the <i>Billboard</i> charts. It was received very well with a great appreciation for not only the production quality but also the melodies and cadences present throughout his songs. Without a doubt, a huge appeal for many fans
					is simply the melancholy trap beats present.<br><br>
					It’s clear Juice WRLD crafted a highly personal album when looking at the lyrics and messages that coincide with his music. While I won’t be dissecting a ton of lyrics in the remainder of the review, I feel it is necessary to mention these.
					From Lucid Dreams, Juice sings about a girl who broke his heart; “You left me falling and landing inside my grave/ I know that you want me dead/ I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay”. This resembles the magnitude of this heartbreak and
					all the pain that he felt due to it. By suggesting that this girl is responsible for Juice WRLD to feel as if he is essentially dead, one can only imagine the type of pain caused, especially considering how he takes prescription pills to alter
					his mood. We see many more references to prescription pills throughout the album. To mention more lyrics, on “I’ll Be Fine”, Juice raps about how “Swervo told me stop popping them xannies ‘fore I flatline” along with “My momma told me, stop the
					painkillers/ Them shits is killing me, I’ma be fine”. This unhealthy and abusive behavior Juice raps about hits very hard to listeners, especially those with histories of drug use. According to this, Juice is on the brink of overdosing. He
					believes how he will be fine in the end and that for now temporarily reducing the pain he feels justifies his actions, hence the title of this song.<br><br>
					His lyrics, along with specifically the choruses, are very well crafted in providing flow and emotional evocative language. Considering the sheer despair emotions shown, Juice truly put his thoughts into words, accurately conveying his
					feelings. Moreover, it is important to remember that this is his very first studio album. There is an intense appreciation to many aspects of songs and music that makes it so successful, and Juice is able to execute it in such a remarkable way.<br><br>
					While it is easy to conclude that any music just “sounds good”, I must say that Juice’s beats are very appealing to fans of this genre. Even pop and hip-hop fans would likely agree with this. While I did assert how this genre is emo
					rap/alternative, it is worth noting to take caution in applying these labels to music, and Juice WRLD is not exempt from this. I find it difficult to attach a certain genre or two across his music as he reflects varying levels of mood
					throughout this album while more or less centering around the theme of heartbreak.<br><br>
					<i>Goodbye & Good Riddance</i> is easily one of my favorite personal albums of 2018. It’s a sound that you can vibe to and can be calming as well. Sometimes I have even found his lyrics to represent some of the thoughts that I hold. Overall, I
					believe that Juice is a highly talented and skillful artist who has set the expectation bar very high for himself with the release of his debut album. I cannot wait to see what else he can produce following his very successful album.<br><br>
