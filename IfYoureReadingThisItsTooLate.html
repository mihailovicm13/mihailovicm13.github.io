					<b>Written by Milan Mihailovic</b><br><br>
					<i>If You're Reading This It's Too Late</i> is the fourth commercial release and “mixtape” by Canadian rapper / singer Drake, released on February 13,
					2015.<br><br>
					Drake is not just an icon in the hip-hop world, but in popular culture for the past decade. <a href=”https://voolas.com/impressive-records-drake-has-broken/”>Being one of the most commercially successful artists of the 21st century</a>, most
					  people are probably familiar with him and his music. Drake began his celebrity career as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi, six years before he would release his first two mixtapes: <i>Room For Improvement</i> and <i>Comeback Season</i>. However, it
						was not until Lil Wayne signed him to Young Money Records and the release of <i>So Far Gone</i> that Drake would become a rising figure in hip-hop.<br><br>

						<i>So Far Gone</i> set the groundwork for what most of Drake's music would consist of -- moody atmosphere created by the production of Boi-1da and 40, emotional bars, and a somewhat even split of R&B and hip-hop on each subsequent album. <i>Thank
							Me Later,</i> <i>Take Care</i>, and <i>Nothing Was The Same</i> would follow this formula (<i>Take Care</i> still contained songs like “Headlines” and “HYFR”, even if it consisted of mostly R&B).<br><br>

						While both <i>Take Care</i> and <i>If You're Reading This It's Too Late</i>contain such a moody atmosphere, <i>If You're Reading This</i>is, for the most part, a rap album. Most of the songs on the tape are straight to-the-point hip-hop
						bangers. However, as stated, there is always an R&B / hip-hop split present in every release by Drake: a few slower songs begin to appear near the middle and the end.<br><br>

						One could see the song “0 To 100 / The Come Up” (released by Drake in 2014) as a precursor to most of the songs on here. First, we are introduced to a hard-hitting beat courtesy of a great producer like Boi-1da, on which Drake raps on for half
						the song. Then, a beat-switch arrives, turning the production more mellow and atmospheric – sometimes Drake will begin to sing in this half as well. Songs that follow this formula and do it great on this tape include “Know Yourself”, “No
						Tellin’”, “6 God”, “Star67”, and “6 Man”. Each of these songs display Drake’s talent as both a rapper, as well as a singer.<br><br>

						Although many of the songs on here follow such a formula, there are great tracks that are bangers and don’t as well. “Energy”, “10 Bands”, “Used To”, and “6 PM in New York” are straight to the point – Drake comes in and delivers on each of
						these songs. In the case of “6 PM in New York”, he raps for almost 5 minutes with no choruses or hooks to be found. Songs like these prove Drake’s technical ability and either his (or <a href=”https://www.bet.com/news/music/2015/07/22/drake-ghostwriter-quentin-miller.html”>Quentin
						  Miller’s..</a>) songwriting ability.<br><br>

							However, like I mentioned prior, not every song on here is hip-hop. There are slower tracks on here, including “You & The 6” and “Jungle” as well. However, most of these tracks constitute the weak parts of the album. PARTYNEXTDOOR’s producing
							contribution on “Legend” is great, but his two tracks in the middle of the album, “Preach” and “Wednesday Night Interlude”, are not up to par with most of the highlights here. “Preach” has an autotuned hook that is extremely off-putting at
							first. Its verses are decent – nothing amazing – but the outro contains some gorgeous sampling. Overall, not bad, but not a highlight. The other PARTYNEXTDOOR track, “Wednesday Night Interlude” is my least favorite song on here. Those who
							like this type of slow, laid-back R&B may enjoy the track. While it is not horrible, and better than many tracks off <i>So Far Gone</i> or <i>Views</i>, PARTYNEXTDOOR’s solo presence is uninteresting here.<br><br>

							In addition to the PARTYNEXTDOOR tracks, there are other slower songs on this tape. “Company”, featuring Travis Scott, is the moodiest track here. The beginning already sets such a mood with the gloomy synths, minimal drum presence, and dog
							bark sound effects. However, Travis Scott amplifies this vibe, bringing his grim <i>Days Before Rodeo</i> style production and vocals to the track in the second half. Although I’m a fan of both artists, this song is not one of the best
							collaborations between them. I would recommend it, though, for fans of Travis Scott who enjoyed his 2014 era of production. It’s not bad; just uninteresting in my opinion.<br><br>

							The other two slower songs on here are “You & 6”, and “Jungle”: both amazing songs showcasing Drake’s softer side. In “You & 6”, gorgeous string interludes are spaced between verses about Drake’s relationship with his mother. The song opens
							with the lines “having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess, ain’t been returning the texts, so she been reading the press”. This song is Drake at his most vulnerable, and a great insight into his personal life. “Jungle” is another
							personal track, concerning a relationship he has with a girl from the “Jungle” – a nickname for a rough neighborhood in Toronto. The song beautifully samples “6 8” by Gabriel Garzón-Montano (another great track which you should check out even
							if you don’t like Drake’s version). The chord progression and vocal samples from the original assist in creating the sentimental sound of the instrumental. If you like emotional Drake, and even if you don’t, check out this track – it’s
							definitely one of the best tracks.<br><br>

							That leaves two tracks: “Now & Forever” and “Madonna”. Not the most interesting tracks, and there is not much to say about them. The former drags on for too long, and the latter track feels more like an interlude. Despite this, they aren’t
							bad tracks. If you enjoy the chill atmosphere created by “Madonna” or the typical Drake-y style of “Now & Forever”, then they may appeal to you.<br><br>

							Finally, an aspect of this album that I enjoy greatly are the drums. The hip-hop tracks deliver booming trap 808s, snares, and hats that make much of the production here standout. “6 God” has an swift, punchy drum pattern (in addition to a
							creative <a href="https://youtu.be/vLWAg3P_Tsw?t=55">Donkey Kong Country 2 sample</a>), “Energy” and “Know Yourself” contain interesting reversed open hi-hats, “No Tellin’” has bouncy kick drums, and “Jungle” has great drums added onto its
							sample. Even “Now & Forever” contains an
							unorthodox snare sound that I found creative. If you are looking for rhythmic drum patterns in the production, most of the songs here will suit your taste.<br><br>

							Great lines:<br><br>The Tyga diss from “6PM in New York”: “You need to act your age and not your girl’s age”<br><br>No Tellin’: “You pick the casket, I’ll put the nail through it”<br><br>6 Man: “I didn’t do this f****n’ tape for CNN, I’m not
							trying
							to win awards, that shit seem forced”<br><br>Know Yourself: “I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka gets back on the road”<br><br>

							In conclusion, <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</i> is Drake’s best project from a consistency standpoint. It has great highs, and mediocre lows at worst. It stands as one of my favorite rap projects from 2015, and I recommend it for
							any hip-hop fan who hasn’t heard it.<br><br>
