					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (08.18.2019).<br><br>Released July 5, 2019.<br><br>
					<i>Revenge of the Dreamers III</i> (abbreviated to <i>ROTD3</i>) is the highly anticipated follow-up to the compilations that the Dreamville record label released in 2014 and 2015. Headed by rapper J. Cole, the label consists of names like
					J.I.D., Bas, Cozz, the duo EARTHGANG, and many more. On top of the main members of Dreamville, there are many features on this album, including Yung Nudy, DaBaby, and T.I.<br><br>
					Stylistically, the compilation features both hip-hop and R&B. On songs like “Self Love” and “Got Me”, singer Ari Lennox delivers impressive vocals over some mellow instrumentation. On the flip side, tracks like “Wells Fargo – Interlude”, and
					“Costa Rica” are hip-hop bangers. Topic-wise the songs are diverse: “Ladies, Ladies, Ladies” covers past relationships, “PTSD” covers hardships, and “Lambotruck” featuring TDE member REASON is about how him and Dreamville member Cozz don’t get
					enough recognition, and how they (jokingly) should rob their respective label bosses. I was impressed with how conceptual many of the songs here were, considering it is a collaboration.<br><br>
					Generally, the production throughout the project is moody, as seen on tracks like “Down Bad”, “LamboTruck”, “Swivel”, “Costa Rica”, and “Sunset”. There are many production highlights, like the sample flip on “Under The Sun”, the jazz-rap
					progression and sax on “PTSD”, and the BROCKHAMPTON-esque horns on “Wells Fargo – Interlude”. There are various tracks on the compilation like “Wells Fargo” and “Don’t Hit Me Right Now” that feature playful and goofy beats. However, some songs
					have only decent / passable beats, like the boom-bap track “1993”, or the sample-heavy “Ladies, Ladies, Ladies”. One song where I dislike the production completely is “Swivel”, where the beat is too slow and uninteresting to leave any
					impression. Also, the instrumental on “Sleep Deprived” is not nearly as memorable as any of the other R&B tracks on the compilation.<br><br>
					Performance-wise, there is also a great amount of talent. DaBaby’s feature was great and funny (as expected), and Ty Dolla $ign croons nicely on “Got Me”. I was excited to hear Saba on “Sacrifices”, and he comes through with a pretty good
					verse. On “Wells Fargo”, every artist delivers a quick and impressive flow, and Vince Staples comes through with a cold, impactful flow on “Rembrandt…Run It Back”. “PTSD”, my favorite song on the compilation, features beautiful vocals courtesy
					of St. Beauty, who fits the track beautifully. However, there are a few duds in the tracklist, like on “Sunset”, where J. Cole’s delivery sounds very unenthusiastic. “MIDDLE CHILD”, the J. Cole single released back in
					January, has grown on me since; however, I still find both the production and Cole’s performance to be a bit underwhelming and too much of a comercial appeal. Overall, the best performances on the complication come from J.I.D., Ari Lennox,
					Guapdad 4000, and J. Cole.<br><br>
					In summation, <i>ROTD3</i> is a pretty good compilation from Dreamville and showcases the talent of many of its artists. Although there are some uninteresting moments in the tracklist, there are many highlights as well. Overall, it met my
					expectations and is a flawed but nonetheless enjoyable compilation album.<br><br>

					<b>6/10</b><br><br>

					Highlights: Under the Sun, Down Bad, LamboTruck, Wells Fargo - Interlude, Self Love, Costa Rica, Got Me, <b>PTSD</b><br><br>

					Skips: <b>Swivel</b>, Sunset<br><br></p>
