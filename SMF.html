					<b>Written by <a href="Avinash.html">Avinash Pillai</a></b> (10.06.2019).<br><br>Released August 16, 2019.<br><br>
					If you’ve ever talked to a member of Chi O, you’d know that the key factor to a good summer is a good summer album. Young Thug now believes that he can capture that title of “Official Album of Summer 2019”. And in a time where we now attempt to
					idolize a time period as entirely utopian (i.e. “hot girl summer”), <i>So Much Fun</i> seems to have the perfect title for the job. But does it deliver as an album past the catchy, summer album stage?<br><br>

					A first listen to the album would call into question the originality of Thugger’s flow in this album. Initially, it sounds like a NAV album, with odd mixing and far too many copycat lyrics and flows. “Just How It Is” ends up falling flat on a
					chill vibe which seems to directly contradict the album title. How can it be called <i>So Much Fun</i> if it’s not possible to get hype to the song? The listener is definitively not having <i>So Much Fun</i>. The first couple songs do not
					deliver on the promise that Thugger implies from the album’s title.<br><br>

					After listening to an irrelevant song from Machine Gun Kelly (let’s be honest, he was only relevant because he got roasted by Eminem), the listener lands on… “Middle Child”? It’s “Middle Child” by J. Cole, right? Why is “Middle Child” on this
					album? Wait, this is not “Middle Child”? This is “Hot”. I’m not sure how copyright rules work, but this feels almost as sacrilegious as when Bryson Tiller’s producer stole a track from J. Cole’s producer (go read about that if you don’t know).
					From the trumpets to the general flow of the track, it seems like it was at least “heavily inspired” by the J. Cole song.<br><br>

					The album is also all over the place in terms of message. It is generally only an album that gives braggadocios messages about how much money Young Thug and his fellow featured artists have. This is not an album that is going to win any
					Pulitzer prizes. This is not an album that is going to be eventually analyzed by future IB English students (i.e. Kendrick Lamar).<br><br>

					Going further into the album reveals more of the same. Apart from “Bad Bad Bad”, “Boy Back”, and “Mannequin Challenge”, the entire album seems to be more evolutionary than revolutionary. And you know what? That’s fine. Thugger was not trying to
					come out with a crazy album that makes a genuine and deep impact on the hip-hop community. The album is, in the end, just considered <i>So Much Fun</i>. And if the listener adapts their mind from analyzing the album as a ground-shaking project
					to a Playboi Carti-esque project filled with features and catchy tracks, then the listener can learn to appreciate what the album is intended to be. In that sense, the album is a big success. So, to answer that one Chi O member who is currently
					reading this article, yes this is a perfect summer album. And for those of you who are looking for the next T R A P S O U L, this is certainly not it.<br><br>


					<b>5.5/10</b><br><br>

					Highlights: Surf, Hot, Boy Back, Mannequin Challenge<br><br>
					Skips: Circle of Bosses, Ecstasy, Sup Mate<br><br></p>
