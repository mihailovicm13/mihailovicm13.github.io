					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (10.13.2019).<br><br>Released July 31, 2016.<br><br>
					<i>Telefone</i> is the debut mixtape from Chicago femcee Noname, released on July 31st, 2016. It followed a long period of anticipation – the hip-hop community had been waiting years for a debut project from Noname, after hearing her for the
					first time on “Lost” (from Chance The Rapper’s <i>Acid Rap</i>). Stylistically, she shares much in common with fellow Chicagoan artists in the current jazz-rap / neo-soul scene there, including Chance the Rapper, Saba, Smino, theMIND, Phoelix,
					and more. This album represents this new Chicago sound to a tee, and in my opinion better than critically acclaimed contenders like Chance’s <i>Coloring Book</i>, Saba’s <i>Bucket List Project</i>, or Mick Jenkin’s <i>The Water[s]</i>.<br><br>

					Stylistically, the comparisons between Chance and Noname’s rapping have been criticized -- but I still find them to be true. Both artists share a conversation-esque, easy-going flow and personal subject matter. A great part of Noname’s appeal
					is how understated her music is: she has mastered the art of subtle rapping, with a quiet delivery but heartwarming lyrics. To match this understated delivery is laid-back, quiet production from the likes of fellow Chicagoans Saba and Phoelix.
					For its budget, <i>Telefone</i> boasts beautiful a production-quality unexpected on a debut mixtape from a relatively underground artist (in 2016, at least).<br><br>

					In comparison to her 2018 album <i>Room 25</i>, <i>Telefone</i> is noticeably more personal. On that record, themes of politics and religion appear much more frequently than on <i>Telefone</i>, where the focus is more-so based in nostalgia and
					experiences with death. For example, the song “Bye Bye Baby” is a loving-farewell to an aborted child (it is unclear, but likely retells a personal experience of Noname’s). And the song “Diddy Bop” is the ultimate nostalgia tune, detailing
					joyful stories of Noname’s childhood in 1990’s Chicago.<br><br>

					The record begins with the blissful reminiscence of “Yesterday”. Production-wise, the track is laced with beautiful piano melodies, organs, backing-vocals, and vocal loops that sound straight out of a 1950’s film soundtrack. Over the soulful
					chord progression, Noname reminisces over her late Grandma’s smile, coming of age, missing a friend, and material worth. The song is a great introduction to the tape, setting up both the lyrical themes of nostalgia and death, as well as the
					neo- soul / jazz-rap influence on the entire project’s sound.<br><br>

					As previously mentioned, the nostalgic recollections continue on “Diddy Bop”, a song named after a notorious dance move conceived by rapper P. Diddy, popular in the 90’s. As such, the track covers Noname’s childhood experiences in this time
					period. This includes mentions of ice cream, growing out of your clothes, Nike A1’s, and a teenage experience of getting caught smoking weed. Paired with beautiful guest contributions by Cam O’bi and Raury, and breathtakingly smooth production
					that matches the lyrical content of the track perfectly, the track is an amazing auditory experience as well.<br><br>

					In contrast, songs like “Casket Pretty”, “Bye Bye Baby”, and “Shadow Man” cover the subject of death (again, a central theme of the project which should explain the inclusion of a skull on the cover art). Each track covers different types of
					death – “Casket Pretty” is about police brutality in Chicago. The title is in reference to how her black peers in Chicago are “casket pretty”, or ready for the casket. Lyrics like “ain’t no one safe in this happy city” detail the paranoia and
					anxiety Noname has of police brutality and the safety of those who are disenfranchised in her home town. “Bye Bye Baby” details an abortion story in a positive light, attempting to de-stigmatize the idea that abortion is only fueled by greed
					and recklessness. The track is told from two perspectives: both the mother and baby’s in the first and second verses respectively, and is a powerful story of a mother’s bond with her aborted child. Lastly, “Shadow Man” has Noname, Saba, and
					Smino describing their deaths and how their funerals will look. It is a chilling track about accepting the inevitability of death.<br><br>

					On the cuts “Reality Check” and “Forever”, Noname discusses self-confidence and overcoming obstacles in order to achieve success. On “Forever”, there are themes of overcoming your opposition and believing in yourself. Meanwhile, on “Reality
					Check”, Eryn Allen Kane’s hook delivers a message of self-empowerment: “You are powerful beyond what imagine / Just let your light glow”.<br><br>

					“All I Need” and “Sunny Duet” are the albums love songs. “All I Need” takes upon a more somber tone in depicting the difficulty of a romantic relationship, while “Sunny Duet” is more uplifting and hopeful. And Lastly, “Freedom (Interlude)” is a
					culmination of all these themes, not focusing on a single topic but instead approaching various topics at once.<br><br>

					On every track here, Noname shows her talents as an impressive technical rapper, with clever wordplay and a personable flow. But the guest features are all solid as well, with notable highlights including Raury on “Diddy Bop”, Xavier Omär on
					“All I Need”, and Saba on “Shadow Man”.<br><br>

					Praises aside, this mixtape does have its problems, however. The tape honestly falls off after the great run from “Yesterday” to “Reality Check”. “Freedom (Interlude)” somehow sounds like it's an interlude, without even noting the indication in
					the title. It drags, feels inconsequential, and the vapid subject matter leaves it as a low point on the tape. And “Forever” features some well-crafted albeit uninteresting production. Again, both tracks are not bad but just come off as
					inconsequential. Meanwhile, “Casket Pretty” has a good concept but is ultimately too underdeveloped to be a highlight on the project, standing at only 1:51.<br><br>

					Despite a disappointing second half that pales in comparison to the first, Noname’s <i>Telefone</i> is a great project to check out if you are a fan of Chance the Rapper or any of their Chicago contemporaries. Her blend of neo-soul and jazz-rap
					is not necessarily anything boundary-pushing but creates for some amazing highlights.<br><br>


					<b>7/10</b><br><br>
