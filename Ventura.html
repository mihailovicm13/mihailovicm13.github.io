					<b>Written by <a href="Milan.html">Milan Mihailovic</a></b> (08.25.2019)<br><br>Released April 12, 2019.<br><br>
					<i>Ventura</i> is the fourth solo album from singer, rapper, songwriter, and producer Anderson .Paak. On this project, .Paak returns to the neo-soul direction of his sophomore album, <i>Malibu</i>, after the more hip-hop centered <i>Oxnard</i>.
					Personally, I was a huge fan of both of these records, so I was of course excited for <i>Ventura</i>. How did it turn out?<br><br>
					The record starts strong with “Come Home”, a smooth neo-soul ballad revolving around one missing their partner. The instrumental on this track is gorgeous, featuring flutes, guitars, and impressive drum playing backed by a nice smooth chord
					progression. André 3000 delivers an <a href=”https://genius.com/17095827”>impressive rap verse</a> in the second half of this song, as the instrumental switches up and becomes more guitar-based. In addition, the bridge between these two
					  sections is seemless. Another smooth track is “Reachin’ 2 Much”, which features a funk-influenced intro before switching into a breathtaking beat-switch (some of the smoothest production .Paak has ever been on). His harmonies on the second
					  half cannot be understated either, and the melody .Paak sings during “I think I'm doin' way too much” is probably my favorite from <i>Ventura</i>.<br><br>
						More smooth but laid-back tracks on here include “Good Heels”, “Jet Black”, “Winners Circle”, and “Make It Better”. Even though “Good Heels” feels somewhat directionless and underdeveloped, it is too enjoyable while playing for me to have any
						problem with it. In particular, I love Jazmine Sullivan’s contributions to the song and the cautious lyrical content. Speaking of features, Brandy gives a great hook with .Paak on “Jet Black”, and Smokey Robinson’s minimal feature on “Make It
						Better” was also nice. In addition, I appreciated Lalah Hathaway and Norelle’s scat singing on “Reachin’ 2 Much” and “Winners Circle”, respectively.<br><br>
						On “Make It Better”, a soul ballad that sounds very old-school, .Paak gives a sweet vocal performance as he addresses his lover and what they will do as their relationship progresses. Meanwhile, “Jet Black” is less personal and concerns a
						party setting. On both tracks, .Paak comes off very charismatic and convincing.<br><br>
						Lyrically, .Paak delivers funny and thought-provoking bars. His socially conscious lines on “King James” and “Yada Yada” are simple yet effective: “there’s nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge”, and “casually talking that global warmth,
						as if the temperature didn't blow out your perm”. Other tracks like “Good Heels”, “Jet Black, “Winner’s Circle” and “Make It Better” are worthwhile tracks involving .Paak and his relationships.<br><br>
						On the production-side, the instrumentals on here are very intricate and detailed. Listening to “Chosen One” and “Yada Yada”, I still notice new details in the instrumentals periodically. As I already stated, “Come Home” and “Reachin’ 2 Much”
						feature gorgeous intstrumentals. “King James” features the jazziest beat here, complete with a saxophone, and “Yada Yada” features some nice bass and Rhodes playing. “Chosen One” contains some catchy and jazzy piano chords in the second half,
						in addition to synthetic strings and a prominent drum beat. And on “Good Heels”, the light vocal melodies backed by the smooth guitars and bass-playing make it a very dreary song.<br><br>
						The last track, “What Can We Do” is a very sentimental tribute, featuring the late Nate Dogg. It is a very sad yet impactful way to end the album. I loved how .Paak incorporated Nate’s vocals on the track, and even set up a conversation at the
						end of the song using old, pre-recorded studio banter from Nate (recall the similar technique used on “Mortal Man” off Kendrick Lamar’s <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>). Also, I appreciate the creative implementation of what sounds like a sitar,
						and the horns on the track. <br><br>
						My only complaint about the album is the song “Twilight”, whose instrumental features a tedious horn section and drum beat courtesy of Pharrell Williams which I found to be disappointing. However, this track has grown on me since April;
						despite the instrumental, .Paak. still gives a solid vocal performance. Also, the start of “Chosen One” is definitely not bad but only leaves me waiting for the beat-switch: the more interesting part of that song.<br><br>
						Overall, <i>Ventura</i> is just as great as .Paak’s previous efforts, delivering a quality collection of 11 tracks. Everything on here, from the amazing production and performances from .Paak feel effortless. I definitely recommend this
						project; .Paak shows his talents as a charismatic vocalist, and great songwriter / producer.<br><br>

						<b>9/10</b><br><br>
						Highlights: Come Home, Make It Better, <b>Reachin’ 2 Much</b>, Winner’s Circle, Good Heels, Yada Yada, King James, Chosen One, Jet Black, What Can We Do?<br><br>
						Skips: <b>Twilight</b><br><br>
